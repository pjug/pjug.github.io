      <span class="speaker">An Introduction To Data Modeling Techniques in Cassandra</span>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="speakerContent">
      Steve will discuss NOSQL, CAP Theorem, eventual consistency, and data modeling techniques in Cassandra.
      Following that will be a demonstration of some shell commands to create and query tables. We will discuss wide
      and narrow rows in Cassandra, storage options, and capacity planning. We will take a brief look at Titan, a
      graph database that can use Cassandra as a backing store. We will take a look at partition keys, clustering
      columns, time series data, and how these choices affect the storage and performance of the solution. We will
      discuss some of the real world challenges that come up, the trade offs associated with materialized views, plus
      compare and contrast this to a typical relational model. Time permitting we will discuss some real world use
      cases, and how Nike Social is using Cassandra to meet them.

        Clojure is a fascinating new(er) programming language, created by Rich Hickey, that combines the ubiquity and
        performance of Java with the power and expressiveness of Lisp. Clojure excels at interesting problems,
        especially those involving concurrency, but can also freely interoperate with standard Java. Clojure developers
        quickly become passionate about this odd little hybrid: it's easy to learn, yet deeply powerful, and is at the

        WildFly 8 (n&#233;e JBoss Application Server) is Red Hat&apos;s open source Java EE 7 compliant application
        server. It contains robust implementations of WebSocket, Batch, JSON, Concurrency, JMS2, JAX-RS 2, CDI 1.1, and
        all Java EE 7 technologies. Undertow is the new cutting-edge web server in WildFly 8 and is designed for maximum
        throughput and scalability, including environments with over a million connections. The number of ports is
        reduced used by multiplexing protocols over HTTP using HTTP Upgrade.
      </p>

      <p>
        Role Based Access Control support organizations with separated management responsibilities and restrictions.
        Roles represent different sets of permissions such as runtime operation execution, configuration areas that can
        read or written, and the ability to audit changes and manage users. In addition a new restricted audit log can
        be enabled including the ability to offload to a secure syslog server.
      </p>

      <p>
        WildFly also provides a &quot;core&quot; distribution that is ideal for framework authors that want to build
        their own application runtime using the powerful WildFly 8 architecture.
      </p>

      <p>

        Throughout its 18-year evolution, the Java language has played an industry-leading role in the tricky business
        of specifying the behavior of concurrent programs. Java&apos;s contribution became particularly evident with the
        introduction of the Java Memory Model (JMM) in Java 1.5.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is an area in which a down-to-the-metal understanding can help developers strike the right balance between
        safety and performance, so we&apos;ll start by motivating the discussion with counterintuitive low-level
        examples. Then we'll work &quot;up from the weeds&quot; to describe the JMM as a basis for more familiar
        programming patterns. We&apos;ll touch on how C, C++, and C# deal with the same issues and give a nod to
        functional languages and Java 8.
      </p>

      <p>
        This material can help most developers become more insightful about concurrency issues in their code. Be there
        or be unsynchronized!

        We all know that the most challenging programming problems we're likely to face involve threading. Lots and lots
        of threads,
        coordinating and communicating in complex and non-deterministic ways. Clojure by itself gets us part of the way
        there with immutable data-structures and threading primitives (such as atoms and agents), but coordinating many
        threads in the ways demanded by real applications increases complexity and reduces performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        core.async is a new library for Clojure that rationalizes and simplifies coordination of large numbers of
        threads using communicating sequential processes; the end result is manageable code that looks and feels
        synchronous ... easy to read, easy to maintain. As is often the case in Clojure, a few simple primitives work
        together to open up a rich world of possibilities.

        Apache CXF offers the most flexible support for both REST and SOAP of
        any Java web services stack, including support for different XML data
        bindings and JSON output for REST web services. In this presentation
        you'll see how to implement and deploy CXF web services, using both Java
        standards including JAX-RS and JAX-WS and custom CXF extensions. You'll
        also learn about the different configuration options supported by CXF,
        including Spring-based, annotation-based, and direct configuration in
        code, and get an idea of how easily web services projects can be
        implemented using CXF. Finally, you'll see how CXF fits into the Apache
        open source SOA infrastructure.

        The NoSQL movement has given developers many more data storage

        of the quieter options, semantic data stores (also called triple

        Hi,
        I'm Merlyn, a Portland-based programmer with strong ties to both Agile
        PDX and Groovy. I'm also a member of an Agile team at YesMail, and I
        blog under the handle "curious attempt bunny".
      </p>

      <p>
        Come to the session if you want to participate in learning more about
        Gradle. Gradle is a powerful layer of Groovy built on top of a number
        of established tools and libraries. Smart guys have borrowed from the
        pioneering work of Ant, Maven, Gant, Buildr and come up with an
        expressive, concise, and convention-rich build tool for the Java
        family.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this session, there won't be any slides. I'm also not going to
        stand up and talk at you. Instead, I'm going to rely heavily on your
        involvement. I'll start with an introduction to Gradle, and then very
        quickly go into using it in practice. After a few minutes of that I'll
        open it up to go wherever we're most interested in. I'm not a Gradle
        expert, yet I believe that my Groovy background in conjunction with a
        few days of earnest usage have taught me a lot. This session will rely
        heavily on an internet connection, and we'll be googling for answers
        together if need be.

        What is your intention for the session? Spend some time deliberately
        focusing on what it is you want out of the session. Bring that will
        you and share it with us. It will help us all focus on what's
        important and go some way to helping you get the most out of the
        session. Also, go have a quick read about Gradle on their website.
        That will save us all some time, help us get to the interesting
        details sooner, and be a good source of informed questions for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll also be building in some time at the end of the session to gather

      <p>
        Almost every transaction executed on a JEE Application Server winds up distributed over multiple resources such
        as JMS destinations and JDBC datasources. Standard OTLP systems employ the XA-2PC protocol, a presumed-abort
        variant of the Two-Phase Commit protocol to make sure that either all resources commit successfully or all
        resources abort the transaction if at least one resource fails. As any distributed consensus protocol, XA-2PC is
        expensive. In this talk, we present Logging Last Resource (LLR) optimization of XA (actually, its JEE
        "translation" in form of the JTA spec) in Oracle WebLogic Server. LLR's effectiveness has been validated in
        world record results achieved by the Oracle stack in the SPECjAppServer2004 benchmark and by high-profile
        customers in mission-critical applications.

    <div class="prevContent">
      <p>
        In the push to make use of tagging and other forms user-driven information architectures, developers have
        overlooked the value of adding semantics, or contextual meaning, directly to the data that powers web sites and
        applications. The addition of Microformats to a Web site's markup can further the exchange of semantic
        information such as contact information for people and events. For the most part, however, web sites and
        applications are still populated by largely non-semantic prose organized in large blocks of HTML or generated
        from the walled gardens of relational databases and data warehouses.
      </p>

      <p>
        While everyone agrees that HTML isn't going away anytime soon, several Web Standards have arisen over the last
        few years to help application developers store, serve, and distribute information with ever-increasing levels of
        semantics and meaning. The current pinnacle of the Semantic Web Standards pyramid is OWL - the W3C's Web
        Ontology Language. In this talk I will describe the roots and basics of OWL and how it can be used to power the

        Functional programming is (again) a hot topic among developers.
        Languages such as Scala and Clojure have functional concepts at the

        such as Groovy and C# 3.0 include functional concepts. This talk will
        cover whether langauge really matters, some functional techiques that

        GWT is Google's Web Toolkit, a framework for building rich web applications entirely in Java. While a lot of
        people have heard of GWT, most haven't had a look to see just how easy it really is.
      </p>

      <p>
        GWT allows you to collapse your technology stack. Without GWT, getting a web application to look and behave just
        right requires knowledge of HTML, JSP, JavaScript, CSS, JSTL, Java, the web framework of your choice, etc.
        Wouldn't it be nice if you could do everything you needed in Java and just used CSS for display formatting? GWT
        lets you do that. GWT lets you impress your friends with your JavaScript wizardry without having to be a
        JavaScript wizard.

        This talk will be an introduction to GWT, showing how to write a whole app in it, or else augment your existing
        web apps with GWT widgets. Advanced topics, such as integration with Seam, interoperability with legacy
        JavaScript and third-party JavaScript libraries, and code reusability will also be covered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, a live demonstration of coding in GWT will be shown, demonstrating how fast it is to develop web apps
        using this framework.

        Poker bots! The term conjures images of programmers hacking away late at night, trying to make a fast buck. But
        how interesting is the subject really? Well, as it turns out, very interesting. The game of poker poses the dual
        problems of nondeterminism and limited information, making computer poker implementations a deeper conceptual
        challenge than deterministic open-information games like chess. Better, there now exists a body of academic
        literature dedicated to analyzing the subtleties of the problem. But best of all, the de facto standard
        environment for development of poker AI software is 100% pure Java.
      </p>

      <p>
        This talk will begin with a bit of historical context, delve into the problem space, and then offer a
        demonstration and source-level view of working "bots". The bots run in an offline, not-for-money, but highly
        competitive game environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Basic knowledge of the rules to Hold'em Poker (both limit and no-limit tournament varieties) is helpful to
        understand the presentation. This is a legitimate AI presentation aimed at professional software developers and
        students. No license agreements or U.S. laws were violated during its creation - and if your goal is to "cheat"
        at online poker, this presentation won't help you very much.

      Client side Java has come a long way in the last decade, but
      Java FX is going to be the biggest change since switching from AWT to
      Swing (maybe even bigger!). This is an overview of where client Java
      stands today, the new technologies coming soon, and the new tools that
      will let developers create incredible new client applications both on
      the desktop and off. After the overview we will deep dive into Java FX
      Script, a new programming language specifically designed for creating
      user interfaces.

      The Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) is the next
      generation of
      Java APIs for web services, replacing The Java API for XML Based RPC.
      JAX-WS focuses on ease of development along with aligning with the
      industries for web services. The JAX-WS reference implementation (RI)
      is a production quality, highly performant implementation of the JAX-WS
      2.1 specification. This talk will present an overview of the JAX-WS
      APIs and then will spend the majority of the time presenting how web
      services can be developed with the JAX-WS RI as well as the
      architecture
      of the RI. As JAX-WS is part of the GlassFish project an overview of
      Glassfish will also be presented.

      Scott Davis is the Editor in Chief of <a href="http://aboutGroovy.com">aboutGroovy.com</a>. The
      website, in
      addition to being, umm, about Groovy, is implemented in Grails. This
      talk shows you how to get started with Grails, but also talks about the
      experience of using it in a live, production web site.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grails is a web framework that maximizes the strengths of familiar Java
      libraries Spring, Hibernate, and Sitemesh, to name a few while
      minimizing the XML jockeying it usually takes to get them all to play
      nicely with one another. It brings "Convention over Configuration" to
      Java. It uses Groovy as the language to glue the pieces together, which
      means that experienced JEE developers can learn Groovy in the context
      of
      libraries that they are already familiar with.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grails includes a web server, a database, and all of the libraries
      necessary for a full-fledged web application. It will even generate a
      directory structure and scaffold common classes (Controllers, Views,
      etc.). It is no exaggeration to say that you will have your first
      application up and running in minutes. But Grails is more than about a
      quick start. In this talk, we'll look at ways to move beyond the
      default
      configurations. We'll deploy a Grails app to an external Tomcat
      instance
      instead of the included Jetty server. We'll move from the default
      HSQLDB
      database to MySQL. We'll include external JARs to bring new
      functionality to the mix.

      Join us in January as we discuss component based development
      (CBD). We will discuss the motivation behind CBD and the agility it
      gives your development team. </p>

    <p>
      CBD can turbo-charge your team's efforts by encouraging good OO basics
      (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance) and OO
      Principles (Encapsulate what varies, Favor composition over
      inheritance, Program to interfaces not impls).
    </p>

    <p>
      CBD helps mitigate risks in your application by allowing easy
      replacement of components with an alternate implementation. CBD also
      encourages the easy use of mock objects and test-first development too.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will discuss terms like "Inversion of Control" (IoC) and the
      "Hollywood Principle". We will talk about the importance of managing
      dependencies and ways to automatically wire dependent components.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although we will focus on the most popular IoC container (Spring), we
      will also demonstrate different strategies of IoC such as the good ol'
      AbstractFactory and PicoContainer that existed before Spring. We will
      also see how it's possible, with proper design, to replace your IoC

    <p>Struts
      is an application framework from the Apache Jakarta Project.
      It is
      widely used for enterprise web applications, which have unique
      characteristics
      and development problems. The Struts framework fits
      neatly
      into this environment, providing base classes and design
      patterns
      that expedite development and ease maintenance, especially
      for large
      applications.
      In this
      talk, we will give an overview of the Struts framework,
      including
      the configuration files and major components. We will also
      present
      several Struts design patterns and coding idioms that are
      useful for
      enterprise applications, which typically include complex
      workflow,
      as well as form-based data entry.

      Enterprise
      Application Integration (EAI) has been a top priority within IT for a
      number of years, but EAI solutions can be costly and difficult to
      manage. The Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) model builds on traditional
      EAI concepts and message-oriented middleware to provide an
      event-driven, scalable approach to solving difficult EAI challenges.
      This
      presentation will describe the major characteristics of an ESB
      implementation, and how they fit together in real EAI projects. While
      ESB is a platform-neutral model, we will site examples of Sonic
      Software's Java-based implementation and ESB's relationship to Java
      standards such as JCA and JBI.

    <p>
      Performance Tuning of J2EE
      applications has not been effective until
      recently. Most J2EE applications are not tuned using modern
      tools and methodologies due to their unique architecture compared to
      legacy applications. Effective performance tuning requires
      measurements which were not easily available until recently.
      This presentation will address performance tuning of J2EE applications
      that typically run in an application server framework. We will
      look at the right way to address performance tuning for J2EE
      applications by looking at a methodology as well as common J2EE
      performance bottlenecks.</p>

    <p>
      The talk will include:<br>
      - What is a good methodology?<br>
      - Describe how the methodology is applied to common performance
      problems<br>
      - Examine 4 common performance problems and show how to

      <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>
      is a
      "powerful, ultra-high performance object/relational persistence
      and query service for Java". Basically, Hibernate allows you to
      easily bridge the world of objects to the world of databases. It has
      the distinction of being the most popular Java mapping solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have
      developed or seen a half-dozen home-grown mapping
      solutions. When I discovered Hibernate, I quickly realized its value.
      When
      developing Viztas's <a href="https://www.viztas.com/Z/home">website</a>
      I quickly decided to
      use this simple but powerful tool to map my database to POJOs (plain
